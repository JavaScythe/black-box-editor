# black-box-editor
superior replacement for nearly defunct simulator for black-box

Implements close to none of the blackbox api (matrix.pixel.toggle, matrix.turn_all_off)

C compiled to browser WASM server-side, served back to preview. Relies on working emcc install.

Tested here with my bad apple rendition.
